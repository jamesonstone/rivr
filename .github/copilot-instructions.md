# GitHub Copilot Repository Instructions

## Native Planning

Use native planning for research and design. Before implementation, inspect code and repository documentation, then decide whether material rationale requires a living `SPEC.md`. Capture the accepted plan before code when it does. After validation, load `docs/references/rules/constitution-curation.md` and curate durable decisions into the correct repository document; code-and-test-sufficient work may report that no documentation update was required.

Start with `docs/agents/README.md`. Before implementing API or backend routes, handlers, services, repositories, persistence adapters, or gateways, load `docs/references/rules/backend-service-architecture.md`. Before implementing frontend routes or pages, feature orchestration, state flows, data adapters, or reusable components, load `docs/references/rules/frontend-application-architecture.md`. Treat both rules as responsibility boundaries rather than mandatory directory names, and preserve stronger repo-local architecture.

Before implementation or validation, load `docs/references/rules/testing-and-environment-validation.md` and the project's `docs/references/testing.md`. Preserve language-native code-level tests and pull-request checks; end-to-end and live-integration suites supplement rather than replace them.

Before editing implementation/source or test files, load `docs/references/rules/source-file-size.md`. Keep every version-control-eligible handwritten implementation/source and test file at 300 physical lines or less, and audit the complete affected scope before delivery.

Before Git, GitHub, or AWS mutations, load `docs/agents/GUARDRAILS.md` and relevant `docs/references/rules/*`. Repo-local Kit rules outrank generic defaults.

## Final Response

Every implementation final response must include:

- Repository Memory
- Decision: created | updated | refactored | deleted | not required
- Rationale: why this persistence decision is correct
- Artifacts: paths or none
